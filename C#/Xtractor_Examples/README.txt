The Xtractor evaluation license allows for 10 extractions in the application before you will need to restart 
the application. The count will be application level, not instance level, meaning that no matter how many 
instances of Xtractor you have, no matter how many threads youâ€™re using, etc. you get extractions in 
your application. 

If your testing environment requires more flexibility, please contact sales@activepdf.com and request a temporary non-evaluation license key.
